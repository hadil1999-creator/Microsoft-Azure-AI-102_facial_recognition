There are two implementation options: `C#` or `Python3` included in this repository:
1. `**main_facial_recognition.py**`: This is the main facial recognition Python script responsible for detecting faces in the input video and drawing bounding boxes with names for identified world leaders.
2. `**g20_leaders_faces.py**`: This file contains a small database of vectorized faces belonging to various G20 world leaders. The main script uses this database for face comparison during the recognition process.
